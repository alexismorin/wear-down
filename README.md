# wear-down
## One-click Maya Python script to wear down shapes into old concrete

Just select a low-poly mesh of your choosing and run the script.

### Variables

- How big the chunks taken off the mesh are by default
minChunkScale = 0.2
maxChunkScale = 0.5

- Multiplier for how deformed chunks are based on the length of the edge of which they are in
chunkDeformScale = 0.5

- Probability of chunking per edge meter. 1.5 means that for a 2 meter edge, you get three chunks.
chunkRatioPerUnit = 0.75
