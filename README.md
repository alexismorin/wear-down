Just select a low-poly mesh of your choosing and run the script.

### Variables

- minChunkScale/maxChunkScale: How big the chunks taken off the mesh are by default

- chunkDeformScale: Multiplier for how deformed chunks are based on the length of the edge of which they are in

- chunkRatioPerUnit: Probability of chunking per edge length. 1.5 means that for a 2 meter edge, you get three chunks.
